      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Daniel Brott. I am a software developer with a history in I.T. infrastructure. I've worked for several years now on the hardware side of I.T, as well built multiple computers. I've always had a passion for computers and would like to understand more of the software side of computers. The skill of software development is  becoming increasingly important in everyday life and it's also a skill that is always changing and has a variety of problems to tackle.  Many of my hobbies are relevant to software development, I've managed video game servers for a few different games, which didn't involve a lot of coding but I had to edit a lot of values in the text files to tailor the game server for the people playing on the server. This helped me get savvy in writing and reading code as well as debugging, since often looking for and manipulating values is similar to reading and changing/writing code and I'm looking forward to working with you!",
